# TerraX-Cloud


**Terrax** is a powerful, UI-driven tool that simplifies infrastructure management with Terraform — no coding required.

---

## 🚀 Overview

Terrax enables you to **generate**, **import**, and **manage** infrastructure using Terraform — all from a clean, intuitive web interface. Whether you're spinning up new resources or importing existing ones (like from Cloudflare), Terrax handles it all in a centralized and automated way.

---

## 🎯 Key Features

- 🧱 **No-Code Interface**: Define infrastructure visually—Terrax auto-generates the Terraform code behind the scenes.
- 📥 **Import Existing Infrastructure**: Seamlessly bring in your existing resources (e.g., from Cloudflare) and manage them as Terraform code.
- 📍 **Centralized Management**: View and deploy your entire infrastructure from one place.
- 🗂️ **Terraform State Handling**: Secure, automated Terraform state file management.
- 🔄 **Git Integration**: All code is version-controlled via Git for easy tracking and collaboration.
- 🛡️ **Automatic Backups**: Your Terraform files and state are regularly backed up to support disaster recovery.
