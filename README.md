# TerraX-Cloud

**Terrax** is a powerful, UI-driven tool that simplifies infrastructure management using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) — no coding required.
   https://app.terrax-cloud.com/
---

## 🚀 Overview

Terrax enables you to **generate**, **import**, and **manage** infrastructure using IaC — all from a clean, intuitive web interface. Whether you're spinning up new resources or importing existing ones (like from Cloudflare), Terrax handles it all in a centralized and automated way.

---

## ⚙️ Compatibility

Terrax generates **IaC configurations compatible with [Terraform®](https://www.terraform.io/)**, allowing you to apply infrastructure changes using Terraform as an external tool.

> Terraform is a third-party tool by HashiCorp and is not included or bundled with Terrax.

---

## 🎯 Key Features

- 🧱 **No-Code Interface**: Define infrastructure visually — Terrax auto-generates the configuration for you.
- 📥 **Import Existing Infrastructure**: Seamlessly bring in your existing resources (e.g., from Cloudflare) and manage them as code.
- 📍 **Centralized Management**: View and deploy your entire infrastructure from one place.
- 🗂️ **State File Handling**: Secure, automated management of your IaC state files.
- 🔄 **Git Integration**: All configurations are version-controlled via Git for easy tracking and collaboration.
- 🛡️ **Automatic Backups**: Your infrastructure definitions and states are regularly backed up to support disaster recovery.
